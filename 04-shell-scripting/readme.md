# 🐚 **Module 4 — Shell Scripting & Automation**

*Where the terminal becomes a programming language*

Linux commands make you effective.
**Shell scripting makes you unstoppable.**

A script can:

* deploy servers while you sleep
* rotate logs daily without your presence
* monitor CPU, RAM, disk and alert you
* auto-restart crashed services
* backup and rotate databases
* orchestrate full workflows and pipelines

If CLI is a sword, **shell scripting is forging your own weapons.**

This module turns you from a command user → into an automator.

## 📘 **Module Structure (Like Chapters in a Book)**

| Section  | Topic                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **4.1**  | What is Shell? Bash? Sh vs Bash? How scripts are executed? |
| **4.2**  | Variables, Quoting, Environment, Substitution              |
| **4.3**  | Conditions — if/else, exit codes, test operators           |
| **4.4**  | Loops — for, while, until, break/continue                  |
| **4.5**  | Functions — reusable logic design                          |
| **4.6**  | Arguments — `$0 $1 $2 $# $@` input-driven scripting        |
| **4.7**  | File Handling — read/write, redirect, append, here-doc     |
| **4.8**  | Arrays & Strings Manipulation                              |
| **4.9**  | Cron Automation — scheduling tasks                         |
| **4.10** | Logging & Debugging Scripts                                |
| **4.11** | Error Handling & Safe Execution (`set -e`, trap)           |
| **4.12** | Advanced Patterns — parallel exec, pipelines, sub-shells   |
| **4.13** | Writing Production-Grade Automation Scripts                |
| **4.14** | Real Projects (DevOps/SRE Grade)                           |

Every file will be later written like a real chapter —
**explanation → reasoning → design patterns → real examples → labs.**

## 🧪 Hands-On Labs (Later we will build each together)

| Lab   | What you will automate                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab01 | Write your first script — print, variables, loops |
| Lab02 | System monitoring — CPU/RAM/Disk alerts           |
| Lab03 | Log analyzer using grep/awk/sed pipelines         |
| Lab04 | Auto-backup + retention + rotation                |
| Lab05 | Auto restart if a service goes down               |
| Lab06 | Cron-based daily automation workflow              |

By the end of this module, you won't write scripts — **you will write systems.**
